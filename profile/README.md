# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to Team 1771's GitHub page! This is where we store our code for each robot we have built over the years. 

### If you're just getting started with the team, we recommend checking out our [Crash Course](github.com/team1771/crash-course/wiki) on C++ (the programming language we use) and how to use it in coding robots!

### If you'd like to see some of our work, look at [Black Widdow (in service 2020-22)](https://github.com/TEAM1771/Black-Widdow-2022-Update) and [The Return of O-Bob (2021-22)](https://github.com/TEAM1771/THE-RETURN-OF-OBOB-2021).
